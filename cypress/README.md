# Quasar GoogleMaps Cypress

Example of a Quasar app with Google Maps and Cypress automated tests

## Technologies:

- Quasar v1
- Google Maps API
- Google Maps Places API
- Google Maps Directions API
- Cypress

## Objective

You will learn how to use the Google Maps APIs to add markers, draw circles, search for places and draw paths to the destinations in a Quasar app. Then we will test the application with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), an amazing tool for testing front-end applications. For more examples about Cypress, visit the [Vila do Sil√≠cio](http://viladosilicio.com.br/testes-e2e-com-cypress-no-quasar-framework/) blog.

Try the app now running on [quasar-googlemaps.surge.sh](https://quasar-googlemaps.surge.sh/#/).

## Before Start

Install the latest version of Cypress by running this command:

```batch
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

## Google Maps

Go to [Google developers console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and create a project.

![google01](/docs/google01.JPG)

Activate the APIs and services.

![google02](/docs/google02.JPG)

Search for the Places API and enable it.

![google03](/docs/google03.JPG)

Create credentials with the API Key type.

![google04](/docs/google04.JPG)

Copy the API key.

![google05](/docs/google05.JPG)

Search for the Maps Javascript API and enable it.

![google06](/docs/google06.JPG)

The same API Key will be used by default.

![google07](/docs/google07.JPG)

Search for the Directions API and enable it.

![google08](/docs/google08.JPG)

Three APIs will be used: Directions, Maps and Places.

![google09](/docs/google09.JPG)

## Quasar

Now let's go to the code.
In the root folder of the project, add the map API key created before.

![quasar01](/docs/quasar01.JPG)

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the app:

```bash
quasar dev
```

The main screen contains a search field and a map. The user position is detected and a red marker is positioned at the center of the map.

![quasar02](/docs/quasar02.JPG)

The map contains two buttons at its right side: the Camera Button and the Circle Button.

![quasar03](/docs/quasar03.JPG)

The Camera button animates the map camera toward the user's position.

![quasar04](/docs/quasar04.JPG)

The Circle button with a plus icon opens a modal that allows the user to add a circle around its marker with a customized color, radius and opacity. If the Circle button has a minus icon, it will remove the circle.

![quasar05](/docs/quasar05.JPG)

The circle has no effect in the map. It is just a fun feature to use ^\_^.

![quasar06](/docs/quasar06.JPG)

The search field above the map lists the places at each character typed.

![quasar07](/docs/quasar07.JPG)

Click on one option and a blue marker will be added to the map at the place's position with its full address inside the info window

![quasar08](/docs/quasar08.JPG)

Once the place is marked on the map, the Directions button will be visible next to the search field.

![quasar09](/docs/quasar09.JPG)

After clicked, a path will be drawn between the origin (the user's position) and the destination (the place's position).
The total distance between them will be shown at the bottom.

![quasar10](/docs/quasar10.JPG)

After the path is drawn, the Clear button will be visible instead of the Directions button and it will allow to remove the place's marker and the drawn path.

![quasar11](/docs/quasar11.JPG)

## Cypress

Now let's test our application automatically.
Inside the "/cypress/integration" folder are the test scripts to be executed.
While keeping the application running, open the Cypress Browser with this command in another terminal:

```batch
npm run cypress
```

It will list the test files inside the "/cypress/integration" folder.

![cypress01](/docs/cypress01.JPG)

Click on each option to open the test window, allow the geolocation detection when asked and wait for the result.
Some of the test need the user interaction.
